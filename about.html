          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            We are a part of the Grail research team. That is currently headed
            by Elias trying to find one of our lost team-members.
          </p>
          <p>
            William Earburrough went missing on the 23rd of warmwind. We believe
            something nefarious has happened to him
          </p>
          <p>
            This site was created with a Terran translator in hopes of
            establishing contact between the empire of Mitheria and the planet
            known as Tellus. Anything that can help point us in the direction of
            our lost co-worker is greatly appreciated not only by us but by his
            wife and child aswelll.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have a contact page that will let you send us clues that you
            believe that can help us in our journey.

          <h2>What is Mitheria</h2>
          <p>
            Mitheria is the division that is currently in power in our world.
            Formerly a military focused regime, the last two hundred years have
            seen incredible technological advances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through the hardwork of Mitherian citizens we have created weapons
            to fight agains the creatures that lurk in the dark, and while not a
            word most of us enjoied to use for the longest time, the monsters.
            this is also why we are contacting you, if we are correct in travel
            through the pockets your world might also be in trouble. And we
            truly wish to start an alliance based on respect and kin-ship with
            all of you. So heed our warnings, if you see the monsters that we
            write about here, please run. Your atmosphere should weaken them to
            the point where they are barely able to exist, but these creatures
            they are quite adaptable and we fear that they can overcome this.

          <h2>Last seen</h2>

          <p>
            This is the spot where William was last seen in our world, we have
            been trying to find where this is in your, but it seems the tunnels
            are forever changeing, but we believe a place simple known to you as
            "stonehenge" would be the most appropriate guess. If any of you are
            nearby and find this confused man, tell him that we are working on a
            way to get him back. And please help him recharge the suit, your
            atmosphere will kill him.
